theme with unmatched feature name

Narrative:
Mismatched Feature file name with Feature keyword description
  This feature in this theme has theme/epic parents with names theme_with_unmatched_feature_name/epic_with_unmatched_feature_name,
  but because the feature file name (feature_with_unmatched_feature_name.feature) does not match the Feature:
  keyword description in the feature file (Mismatched Feature file name with Feature keyword description), the parent
  theme and epic do not show up on the Serenity BDD report requirements / home page.

  Additionally, this theme will show in the Themes tab, but the Epic and Feature no longer show up under those tabs.
