EpicWithCamelCase

Narrative:
EpicWithCamelCase is part of the set of following themes/epics/features that have been included in the test suite, showing the space, underscore, dash and camelCase naming convention are all valid as long as the names are unique.
- theme with space/epic with space/feature with space.feature
- theme_with_underscore/epic_with_underscore/feature_with_underscore.feature
- theme-with-dash/epic-with-dash/feature-with-dash.feature
- themeWithCamelCase/epicWithCamelCase/featureWithCamelCase.feature

The following themes/epics/features have been included in the tests suite, but because the names are not considered unique by Serenity, only one shows up in the report.  This is expected behavior.
- my theme/my epic/my feature.feature
- my_theme/my_epic/my_feature.feature
- my-theme/my-epic/my-feature.feature
- myTheme/myEpic/myFeature.feature
